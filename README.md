During my internship at CODTECH, I worked on developing a Real-Time Collaboration Tool using Spring Boot, WebSocket, and MySQL. This tool was designed to allow multiple users to collaborate in real-time on shared content, such as code snippets, notes, or tasks, by syncing their changes instantly through a live connection. The primary objective was to implement a smooth, scalable, and responsive collaboration platform with real-time syncing capability and persistent data storage.

The backend of the application was built using Spring Boot, which provided a lightweight, modular framework to handle the application’s REST APIs and real-time messaging endpoints. One of the core components of this tool was the WebSocket-based communication layer, which enabled bi-directional communication between the server and multiple clients. WebSocket endpoints were created using Spring’s @ServerEndpoint and SimpMessagingTemplate, allowing clients to send and receive updates instantly.

Each collaborative session had a unique identifier, and changes made by any participant were immediately broadcast to others in the same session. I used STOMP over WebSocket for structured messaging, ensuring compatibility and better control of the message flow. Spring Security was used to handle authentication and protect session data, ensuring that only authenticated users could join a session.

To enhance performance and prevent unnecessary load on the server, I implemented debounce mechanisms on the client side. This ensured that rapid typing or cursor movements didn't overwhelm the server with too many messages. On the server side, I optimized WebSocket message handling using thread-safe queues and event-driven processing. I also implemented message batching for high-frequency updates to maintain smooth client-side rendering.

For persistence, I integrated a MySQL database to store session data, change history, and user activities. Each session’s changes were logged in real-time, enabling features like undo/redo and full session recovery. I used JPA repositories and proper entity relationships to manage collaboration data efficiently, which not only ensured data integrity but also allowed the admin to monitor usage patterns.

One of the major challenges I tackled was ensuring conflict-free synchronization when multiple users edited the same document. To solve this, I used a basic version control mechanism with time-stamped changes and a priority-based update model. Additionally, the front end (optional demo) was connected using JavaScript and SockJS to provide a clean and responsive user interface.
